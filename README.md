# Documentology: A Multimodal KAG System
Documentology is an experimental project aimed at developing a multimodal Knowledge Graph (KAG) system designed to handle and reason over diverse document types and atomic entities, ranging from text and tables to images and more. By integrating multiple modalities, Documentology transforms how we extract, connect, and leverage knowledge across different formats of information.

### Why Multimodal?
Traditional KAG systems are often limited to text-based inputs or heavily rely on structured data. Documentology goes beyond these constraints by:

Enhancing Information Coverage: Combining modalities allows us to extract insights from visual elements, semi-structured tables, and unstructured text within the same system.
Improving Contextual Understanding: Multimodal approaches enable the system to infer and reason across diverse data sources, ensuring richer, more accurate knowledge extraction.
Real-World Applicability: Documents in the wild are rarely homogeneous. Documentology is built to tackle the messy, interconnected nature of real-world data.
Combining Ontological Graphs with Knowledge Graphs
A key feature of Documentology is its integration of ontological graphs with knowledge graphs derived from texts and documents. This combination creates a more structured and semantically enriched framework for knowledge representation.

### Ontological Graphs: 
Provide a high-level framework that defines concepts, categories, and relationships, forming a solid foundation for organizing knowledge.
Knowledge Graphs from Texts and Documents: Allow for the extraction of dynamic, context-specific knowledge from unstructured data, bridging real-world information with structured understanding.
Together, these graph types enable Documentology to offer a more comprehensive and adaptive knowledge structure that can grow with the complexity of both data and relationships, allowing for better reasoning and insight discovery.

### 3D UI for Graph Navigation and Questioning
To enhance user interaction, Documentology will feature a 3D user interface (UI) that enables intuitive navigation of the knowledge graph. Users will be able to explore and interact with multimodal data within the graph using a spatial and interactive environment. Key features include:

Visual Exploration: Navigate through nodes and edges representing concepts, relationships, and knowledge, with the ability to zoom in and out of different graph layers.
Querying the Graph: Users can ask natural language questions, and the 3D interface will highlight relevant nodes, providing an interactive and dynamic response to queries.
Contextual Exploration: The 3D interface will help users explore the connections between data, showing how different document modalities (text, images, tables) relate to each other in a spatial, visual context.
This 3D visualization approach not only makes the graph more interactive and accessible but also provides an immersive way to understand complex relationships and insights derived from diverse documents.

### Tackling Graph Challenges
Building a robust knowledge graph (KG) that works seamlessly in a multimodal context presents unique challenges:

Data Representation: How do we unify knowledge from disparate modalities (images, text, tables) and integrate ontological and knowledge graphs into a cohesive structure?
Scalability: Multimodal inputs increase the complexity of graph construction and querying, requiring innovative solutions to maintain efficiency.
Semantic Alignment: Ensuring consistency between modalities (e.g., aligning an image's content with related text) is key to avoiding fragmented graphs.
In Documentology, we're actively exploring and evaluating novel approaches to overcome these hurdles, including embedding-based techniques, hybrid graph structures, and adaptive data pipelines.
